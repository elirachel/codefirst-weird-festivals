	<h1> La Tomatina </h1>

		<p> You've probably heard of the famous festival during which crazy Spaniards (and/or crazy food fight enthusiasts) gather on the streets of the city of Buñol in Valencia, and throw tomatoes at one another. Since 1945, La Tomatina has been held in the Spanish town on the last Wednesday of August. It is thought that the festival started when the vexed townspeople rioted and threw tomatoes at the councilmen. The fight itself lasts about an hour, but people travel from all over the world to take part. At around 11 a .m., the first event of the Tomatina begins when a ham is placed upon a tall, greased pole, and the tomato fight can begin only when someone is able to climb to the top and bring it down. Buñol happens to be situated 30km from the sea, so once the fight is over a trip to the beach is an option! </p>
