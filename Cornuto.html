	<h1>Festa del Cornuto</h1>
	

	<p>Held in November in a small Italian town called Rocca Canterano, is perhaps our most questionable festival, La Festa del Cornuto (Festival of Horns). The word 'cornuto' in Italian can be used to describe someone who has been cheated on in a relationship...so this is a festival for those who have been cuckolded. At this event you can expect to see people marching through the streets of the town wearing horns on their heads. You may also witness some floats carrying storytellers, and you could be asked to 'fare la corna' (we will leave it to you to work out the meaning of that one...). The comune of Rocca Canterano (of only 196 inhabitants) is located only 45km East of Rome, so once this love-hating night is over, you can visit the ancient, romantic city.</p>

	<p> When? mid November 2017 (exact dates tbc) </p>
	<p> Where? Rocca Canterano, Lazio, Central Italy </p>
